# survival_prediction_project
## Survival Prediction Project - Predictive Modeling Semester Prediction Project:

Used R, Excel, and Tableau to predict which individuals had the highest chance of survival through doing: exploratory data analysis, manipulating data, creating models for prediction, and creating visualizations. This project had test and training data from Kaggle and my professor had all of us in the class try to get the highest score we could. I got the highest percent accurately predicted in the class and presented to the class things that you can do to get a higher percentage accurately predicted. This project was the main semester project before the final in my Predictive Modeling class.
